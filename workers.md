# Writing Workers

A Workflow task represents a unit of business logic that achieves a specific goal, such as checking inventory, initiating payment transfer, etc. A worker implements a task in the workflow.

## Implementing Workers

The workers can be implemented by writing a simple Python function and annotating the function with the `@worker_task`. Conductor workers are services (similar to microservices) that follow the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle).

Workers can be hosted along with the workflow or run in a distributed environment where a single workflow uses workers deployed and running in different machines/VMs/containers. Whether to keep all the workers in the same application or run them as a distributed application is a design and architectural choice. Conductor is well suited for both kinds of scenarios.

You can create or convert any existing Python function to a distributed worker by adding `@worker_task` annotation to it. Here is a simple worker that takes `name` as input and returns greetings:

```python
from conductor.client.worker.worker_task import worker_task

@worker_task(task_definition_name='greetings')
def greetings(name: str) -> str:
    return f'Hello, {name}'
```

A worker can take inputs which are primitives - `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool` etc. or can be complex data classes.

Here is an example worker that uses `dataclass` as part of the worker input.

```python
from conductor.client.worker.worker_task import worker_task
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class OrderInfo:
    order_id: int
    sku: str
    quantity: int
    sku_price: float

    
@worker_task(task_definition_name='process_order')
def process_order(order_info: OrderInfo) -> str:
    return f'order: {order_info.order_id}'

```

### Managing Workers in Application

Workers use a polling mechanism (with a long poll) to check for any available tasks from the server periodically. The startup and shutdown of workers are handled by the `conductor.client.automator.task_handler.TaskHandler` class.

```python
from conductor.client.automator.task_handler import TaskHandler
from conductor.client.configuration.configuration import Configuration

def main():
    # points to http://localhost:8080/api by default
    api_config = Configuration()

    task_handler = TaskHandler(
        workers=[],
        configuration=api_config,
        scan_for_annotated_workers=True,
        import_modules=['greetings']  # import workers from this module - leave empty if all the workers are in the same module
    )
    
    # start worker polling
    task_handler.start_processes()

    # Call to stop the workers when the application is ready to shutdown
    task_handler.stop_processes()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

## Design Principles for Workers

Each worker embodies the design pattern and follows certain basic principles:

1. Workers are stateless and do not implement a workflow-specific logic.
2. Each worker executes a particular task and produces well-defined output given specific inputs.
3. Workers are meant to be idempotent (Should handle cases where the partially executed task, due to timeouts, etc, gets rescheduled).
4. Workers do not implement the logic to handle retries, etc., that is taken care of by the Conductor server.

## System Task Workers

A system task worker is a pre-built, general-purpose worker in your Conductor server distribution.

System tasks automate repeated tasks such as calling an HTTP endpoint, executing lightweight ECMA-compliant javascript code, publishing to an event broker, etc.

### Wait Task

> [!tip]
> Wait is a powerful way to have your system wait for a specific trigger, such as an external event, a particular date/time, or duration, such as 2 hours, without having to manage threads, background processes, or jobs.

#### Using Code to Create Wait Task

```python
from conductor.client.workflow.task.wait_task import WaitTask

# waits for 2 seconds before scheduling the next task
wait_for_two_sec = WaitTask(task_ref_name='wait_for_2_sec', wait_for_seconds=2)

# wait until end of jan
wait_till_jan = WaitTask(task_ref_name='wait_till_jsn', wait_until='2024-01-31 00:00 UTC')

# waits until an API call or an event is triggered
wait_for_signal = WaitTask(task_ref_name='wait_till_jan_end')

```
#### JSON Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "wait",
  "taskReferenceName": "wait_till_jan_end",
  "type": "WAIT",
  "inputParameters": {
    "until": "2024-01-31 00:00 UTC"
  }
}
```
### HTTP Task

Make a request to an HTTP(S) endpoint. The task allows for GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD, and PATCH requests.

#### Using Code to Create HTTP Task

```python
from conductor.client.workflow.task.http_task import HttpTask

HttpTask(task_ref_name='call_remote_api', http_input={
        'uri': 'https://orkes-api-tester.orkesconductor.com/api'
    })
```

#### JSON Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "http_task",
  "taskReferenceName": "http_task_ref",
  "type" : "HTTP",
  "uri": "https://orkes-api-tester.orkesconductor.com/api",
  "method": "GET"
}
```

### Javascript Executor Task

Execute ECMA-compliant Javascript code. It is useful when writing a script for data mapping, calculations, etc.

#### Using Code to Create Inline Task

```python
from conductor.client.workflow.task.javascript_task import JavascriptTask

say_hello_js = """
function greetings() {
    return {
        "text": "hello " + $.name
    }
}
greetings();
"""

js = JavascriptTask(task_ref_name='hello_script', script=say_hello_js, bindings={'name': '${workflow.input.name}'})
```
#### JSON Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "inline_task",
  "taskReferenceName": "inline_task_ref",
  "type": "INLINE",
  "inputParameters": {
    "expression": " function greetings() {\n  return {\n            \"text\": \"hello \" + $.name\n        }\n    }\n    greetings();",
    "evaluatorType": "graaljs",
    "name": "${workflow.input.name}"
  }
}
```

### JSON Processing using JQ

[Jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) is like sed for JSON data - you can slice, filter, map, and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep, and friends let you play with text.

#### Using Code to Create JSON JQ Transform Task

```python
from conductor.client.workflow.task.json_jq_task import JsonJQTask

jq_script = """
{ key3: (.key1.value1 + .key2.value2) }
"""

jq = JsonJQTask(task_ref_name='jq_process', script=jq_script)
```
#### JSON Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "json_transform_task",
  "taskReferenceName": "json_transform_task_ref",
  "type": "JSON_JQ_TRANSFORM",
  "inputParameters": {
    "key1": "k1",        
    "key2": "k2",
    "queryExpression": "{ key3: (.key1.value1 + .key2.value2) }",
  }
}
```

## Worker vs. Microservice/HTTP Endpoints

> [!tip] 
> Workers are a lightweight alternative to exposing an HTTP endpoint and orchestrating using HTTP tasks. Using workers is a recommended approach if you do not need to expose the service over HTTP or gRPC endpoints.

There are several advantages to this approach:

1. **No need for an API management layer** : Given there are no exposed endpoints and workers are self-load-balancing.
2. **Reduced infrastructure footprint** :  No need for an API gateway/load balancer.
3. All the communication is initiated by workers using polling - avoiding the need to open up any incoming TCP ports.
4. Workers **self-regulate** when busy; they only poll as much as they can handle. Backpressure handling is done out of the box.
5. Workers can be scaled up/down quickly based on the demand by increasing the number of processes.

## Deploying Workers in Production

Conductor workers can run in the cloud-native environment or on-prem and can easily be deployed like any other Python application. Workers can run a containerized environment, VMs, or bare metal like you would deploy your other Python applications.
